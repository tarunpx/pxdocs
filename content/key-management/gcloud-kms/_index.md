Portworx integrates with Google Cloud KMS to store  Portworx secrets for Volume Encryption and Cloud Credentials. This guide will help configure Portworx with Google Cloud KMS. 

Portworx requires the following Google Cloud credentials to use its APIs

- **Google Application Credentials [GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS]**

    Portworx requires permissions to use Google CloudKMS APIs. It requires the following two predefined roles
    - roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
    - roles/cloudkms.publicKeyViewer
    
    More info about these roles and the included permissions can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/permissions-and-roles#predefined_roles)

- **Google KMS Public Key Resource ID [GOOGLE_KMS_RESOURCE_ID]**

    Portworx uses Google's asymmetric key pairs to encrypt and decrypt secrets. More information about asymmetric key pairs and how to create them can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-asymmetric-keys)
    
    Make sure that while creating the asymmetric key you specify the *purpose* of the key as *Asymmetric decrypt*

    Once the asymmetric key is created, provide its complete resourceID to Portworx. A typical asymmetric key pair's resource ID looks like this
    ```
    projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Region>/keyRings/<Key Ring Name>/cryptoKeys/<Asymmetric Key Name>/cryptoKeyVersions/1
    ```
    Portworx requires the above resource ID as an input argument.

## For Kubernetes Users

Provide the Google credentials to Portworx by using any one of these methods

### Google instance IAM roles (Recommended)

{{% content "shared/gce/instance-role.md" %}}

### Google Service Accounts

#### Step 1: Create a service account

{{% content "shared/gce/service-account.md" %}}

#### Step 2: Create a Kubernetes secret for the Google credentials.

Copy the downloaded account file in a directory `gcloud-secrets/` and rename it `gcloud.json` to create a Kubernetes secret from it.

```bash
ls -1 gcloud-secrets
gcloud.json
```

Create a kubernetes secret with the following command

```
 kubectl -n kube-system create secret generic px-gcloud --from-file=gcloud-secrets/ --from-literal=gcloud-kms-resource-id=projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Region>/keyRings/<Key Ring Name>/cryptoKeys/<Asymmetric Key Name>/cryptoKeyVersions/1
```

Make sure to replace the `Project ID`, `Key Ring Name` and `Asymmetric Key Name` in the above command.

#### Step 3: Update the Portworx daemon set

- **New installation**

When generating the [Portworx Kubernetes spec file](https://install.portworx.com/2.0), select `Google Cloud KMS` from the "Secrets type" list.

- **Existing installation**

For an existing Portworx cluster follow these steps:

##### Step 3a: Update Portworx daemon set to use Google KMS secret store

Edit the Portworx daemonset `secret_type` field to `gcloud-kms`, so that all the new Portworx nodes will also start using Google Cloud KMS.

```bash
kubectl edit daemonset portworx -n kube-system
```

Add the `"-secret_type", "gcloud-kms"` arguments to the `portworx` container in the daemonset. It should look something like this:
```yaml
containers:
  - args:
    - -c
    - testclusterid
    - -s
    - /dev/sdb
    - -x
    - kubernetes
    - -secret_type
    - gcloud-kms
    name: portworx
```

##### Step 3b: Patch Portworx daemon set 

Use the following command to patch the daemon set, so that it has access to the secret created Step 2

Create a patch file

```bash
cat <<EOF> patch.yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: portworx
        env:
          - name: GOOGLE_KMS_RESOURCE_ID
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: px-gcloud
                key: gcloud-kms-resource-id
          - name: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
            value: /etc/pwx/gce/gcloud.json
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /etc/pwx/gce
            name: gcloud-certs
      volumes:
        - name: gcloud-certs
          secret:
            secretName: px-gcloud
            items:
              - key: gcloud.json
                path: gcloud.json
EOF
```

Apply the patch

```
kubectl -n kube-system patch ds portworx --patch "$(cat patch.yaml)" --type=strategic
```
## Other users

### Step 1: Provide Google Cloud credentials to Portworx.

Provide the following Google Cloud credentials (key value pairs) as environment variables to Portworx

- [Required] GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=[/path/to/service/account file]
- [Required] GOOGLE_KMS_RESOURCE_ID=[asymmetric_resource_id]

{{<info>}}
**Important:**  
The service account file needs to be present on all the nodes where Portworx is running.
{{</info>}}

### Step 2: Set up Google Cloud MKS as the secrets provider for Portworx.

#### New installation

While installing Portworx set the input argument `-secret_type` to `gcloud-kms`.

#### Existing installation

Based on your installation method provide the `-secret_type gcloud-kms` input argument and restart Portworx on all the nodes.

## Creating Named Secrets

Use the following CLI command to create a new secret in Google Cloud KMS and provide it an identifier/name.

```bash
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets gcloud create-secret --secret_id mysecret --passphrase mysecretpassphrase
```

The above command will create a new key value pair `mysecret=mysecretpassphrase`. Portworx will use Google Cloud KMS to encrypt the 
passphrase `mysecretpassphrase` and store it in its internal metadata store. To use this passphrase for encrypting volumes provide only the secret ID `mysecret` to Portworx while creating/attaching the volume.

To list all the named secrets use the following command

```bash
/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets gcloud list-secrets
```

More information on how to use named secrets is provided in the next section.
